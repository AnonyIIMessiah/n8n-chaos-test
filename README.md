Three-Tier E-Commerce Web Application
Overview
This project is a highly scalable, containerized, three-tier e-commerce web application using modern cloud-native technologies. The stack integrates a React frontend, Node.js/TypeScript backend, an event-driven architecture powered by Apache Kafka, a PostgreSQL database, Redis for caching, and Kubernetes for orchestration. The application simulates a real-world e-commerce platform with full-featured product, order, payment, and user management.

Key Technologies
Frontend: React (with TypeScript), Redux Toolkit, TailwindCSS, served by NGINX within containers

Backend/API: Node.js (TypeScript), Express.js, REST/gRPC APIs, API Gateway for service aggregation

Database: PostgreSQL (primary data), Redis (cache)

Event Streaming: Apache Kafka (asynchronous service communication, decoupled order processing, etc.)

Containerization: Docker, Compose for local development

Orchestration: Kubernetes (K8s) for scaling/deployment, Helm charts for configuration

CI/CD: GitHub Actions or Jenkins pipelines (optional)

Payment Integration: Stripe (or similar) for secure transactions

Cloud/Storage: S3-compatible storage for product/media uploads

Monitoring/Logging: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK or Loki stack

Other: OpenAPI/Swagger for API docs, JWT for authentication, Envoy/nginx for secure ingress

Features
User authentication (JWT-based) and profile management

Product catalog with search and filtering

Shopping cart and checkout flow

Order processing, status tracking, and history

Payment gateway integration and receipt generation

Real-time notifications/events powered by Kafka

Admin dashboard for managing products and orders

Performance optimization using Redis caching

Kubernetes-native scaling and resilience

Getting Started
1. Prerequisites
Docker & Docker Compose

Kubernetes cluster (Minikube, KIND, or cloud K8s)

Node.js (v18+)

Yarn/NPM

PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka (Docker Compose services)

Stripe API keys

2. Local Development
Clone Repository:

text
git clone https://github.com/your_org/modern-ecommerce-3tier.git
cd modern-ecommerce-3tier
Set Up Env Variables:
Copy and adjust .env.example for backend, frontend, and Kafka/Redis:

text
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
Start Local Stack:

text
docker-compose up -d
# or for Kubernetes:
kubectl apply -f k8s/
Run Migrations & Seed Data:

text
cd backend
yarn migrate
yarn seed
Start Development Servers:

Frontend: yarn start inside /frontend

Backend: yarn dev inside /backend

Kafka/Redis/Postgres: Managed via Docker Compose

Microservices & Kafka
Orders, payments, inventory, and notifications are implemented as discrete microservices.

Services subscribe and publish to Kafka topics for event-driven workflows (new orders, inventory updates, payment confirmations, etc.).

Kafka consumers ensure scalable, eventual-consistent processing of business operations.

Database & Caching
PostgreSQL stores users, products, orders, and histories.

Redis caches frequently accessed objects, including product listings and active cart sessions, improving performance.

Security & Compliance
JWT-based authentication and authorization

Rate limiting via NGINX/Envoy

Secure API and DB credential management via Kubernetes secrets

PCI-compliant payment tokenization (Stripe)

Deployment
Docker Compose (Local Only):

text
docker-compose up -d
Kubernetes (Production):

text
kubectl apply -f k8s/
# Edit Helm values.yaml for custom configuration.
Monitoring
Exposes metrics via Prometheus endpoints

Preconfigured Grafana dashboards for traffic, latency, and error rates
